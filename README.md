#### How to use
It is very easy! Install the required modules using pip, add in the crypto symbol you would like to use eg. BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, or XLM etc. Enter the currency you would like to compare it to eg. USD, EUR, GBP etc.
Next set the ammount of days that the prediction model can look into the past and then set the days into the future the model can predict the price of the crypto
Lastly you can adjust the number of epochs on line 54, this will greatly improve the potential accurancy, however this increases the amount of time need to process the data.
